### **Getting Started**


- To get Python working on you own computer you can first download python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). And then download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- To create a notebook on your own computer, open up VScode, and create a file like  hello.ipynb. It's important that you end the file name with .ipynb This tells VSCode that we want a notebook.

- To check that your setup is working **and** to install the necessary packages on your computer download and run the following [notebook](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/business-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/Check_Local_Setup.ipynb)
